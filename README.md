## Description

This challenge was to build an API for social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. This app will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

---

## Motivation

As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

---
